**pocket healer**

pocket healer is a mostly-complete raid healing sim for ios. features include boss ability timers, an interactive encounter space you can tap to move around in, meters, basic commands for the raid (stack/spread/lust etc.), and of course your spells and raid frames.

touch and hold a spell to rearrange spells on the bar. tap the meter to switch modes. you can play as disc priest, holy pally, or (cuz i like pallys i guess) prot pally. unimplemented specs merely spam basic attack, healing, and taunt abilities appropriately, with simple ai.

you can also download your guild's roster from the armory, and play with them. **edit** well, you could last time i was working on this a year or so ago, but apparently they outsourced their web api to a 3rd party since then. i'll fix that at some point.

**mea culpa** spells and effects are modeled in code, which is pretty boneheaded.
